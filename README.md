## Explanation of Key Design Decisions and Trade-offs

Given the simplicity of the project, there were no significant design decisions required. The project was built using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

### Use of Styled-Components

Styled-components were used to manage component-level styling. This choice was made to take advantage of the following benefits:
  - Scoped CSS: Ensures that styles are scoped to individual components, preventing style conflicts.
  - Dynamic Styling: Allows for styling based on component props, making the UI more responsive to state changes.
  - Maintainability: By collocating styles with components, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and scale.

## List of Third-Party Libraries Used and Justification

- TypeScript: Provides static typing, which helps in catching errors early during development and improves code maintainability.
- React: A popular library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture.
- Styled-Components: Used for component-level styling, ensuring styles are scoped, dynamic, and easy to maintain.
